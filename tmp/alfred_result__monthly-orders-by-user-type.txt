    'paragraph': 'The analysis over the period from January 2023 to June 2025 shows a fluctuating pattern of orders made by network and returning users. There is a noticeable trend where network users consistently place more orders than returning users each month, indicating a reliance on acquiring new users. However, the returning user cohort maintains a stable presence, contributing significantly to the total order volume. Strategies focusing on retaining users could potentially boost order volumes further. Periodic increases, possibly correlating with market conditions or promotional activities, exist, offering insights into the optimal times for market campaigns.'
